/*
 * --- Functionality added specific to the BoldToken ---
 *
 * 1) Transfer protection: blacklist of addresses that are invalid recipients (i.e. core Liquity contracts) in external
 * transfer() and transferFrom() calls. The purpose is to protect users from losing tokens by mistakenly sending Bold directly to a Liquity
 * core contract, when they should rather call the right function.
 *
 * 2) sendToPool() and returnFromPool(): functions callable only Liquity core contracts, which move Bold tokens between Liquity <-> user.
