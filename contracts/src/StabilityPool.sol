/*
 * The Stability Pool holds Bold tokens deposited by Stability Pool depositors.
 *
 * When a trove is liquidated, then depending on system conditions, some of its Bold debt gets offset with
 * Bold in the Stability Pool:  that is, the offset debt evaporates, and an equal amount of Bold tokens in the Stability Pool is burned.
 *
 * Thus, a liquidation causes each depositor to receive a Bold loss, in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.
 * They also receive an Coll gain, as the collateral of the liquidated trove is distributed among Stability depositors,
 * in the same proportion.
 *
 * When a liquidation occurs, it depletes every deposit by the same fraction: for example, a liquidation that depletes 40%
 * of the total Bold in the Stability Pool, depletes 40% of each deposit.
 *
 * A deposit that has experienced a series of liquidations is termed a "compounded deposit": each liquidation depletes the deposit,
 * multiplying it by some factor in range ]0,1[
 *
 *
 * --- IMPLEMENTATION ---
 *
 * We use a highly scalable method of tracking deposits and Coll gains that has O(1) complexity.
 *
 * When a liquidation occurs, rather than updating each depositor's deposit and Coll gain, we simply update two state variables:
 * a product P, and a sum S.
 *
 * A mathematical manipulation allows us to factor out the initial deposit, and accurately track all depositors' compounded deposits
 * and accumulated Coll gains over time, as liquidations occur, using just these two variables P and S. When depositors join the
 * Stability Pool, they get a snapshot of the latest P and S: P_t and S_t, respectively.
 *
 * The formula for a depositor's accumulated Coll gain is derived here:
 * https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf
 *
 * For a given deposit d_t, the ratio P/P_t tells us the factor by which a deposit has decreased since it joined the Stability Pool,
 * and the term d_t * (S - S_t)/P_t gives us the deposit's total accumulated Coll gain.
 *
 * Each liquidation updates the product P and sum S. After a series of liquidations, a compounded deposit and corresponding Coll gain
 * can be calculated using the initial deposit, the depositorâ€™s snapshots of P and S, and the latest values of P and S.
 *
 * Any time a depositor updates their deposit (withdrawal, top-up) their accumulated Coll gain is paid out, their new deposit is recorded
 * (based on their latest compounded deposit and modified by the withdrawal/top-up), and they receive new snapshots of the latest P and S.
 * Essentially, they make a fresh deposit that overwrites the old one.
 *
 *
 * --- SCALE FACTOR ---
 *
 * Since P is a running product in range ]0,1] that is always-decreasing, it should never reach 0 when multiplied by a number in range ]0,1[.
 * Unfortunately, Solidity floor division always reaches 0, sooner or later.
 *
 * A series of liquidations that nearly empty the Pool (and thus each multiply P by a very small number in range ]0,1[ ) may push P
 * to its 36 digit decimal limit, and round it to 0, when in fact the Pool hasn't been emptied: this would break deposit tracking.
 * 
 * P is stored at 36-digit precision as a uint. That is, a value of "1" is represented by a value of 1e36 in the code.
 *
 * So, to track P accurately, we use a scale factor: if a liquidation would cause P to decrease below 1e27,
 * we first multiply P by 1e9, and increment a currentScale factor by 1.
 *
 * The added benefit of using 1e9 for the scale factor that it ensures negligible precision loss close to the
 * scale boundary: when P is at its minimum value of 1e27, the relative precision loss in P due to floor division is only on the
 * order of 1e-27.
 *
 * --- MIN BOLD IN SP ---
 *
 * Once totalBoldDeposits has become >= MIN_BOLD_IN_SP, a liquidation may never fully empty the Pool - a minimum of 1 BOLD remains in the SP at all times thereafter.
 * This is enforced for liquidations in TroveManager.batchLiquidateTroves, and for withdrawals in StabilityPool.withdrawFromSP.
 * As such, it is impossible to empty the Stability Pool via liquidations, and P can never become 0.
 *
 * --- TRACKING DEPOSIT OVER SCALE CHANGES ---
 *
 * When a deposit is made, it gets a snapshot of the currentScale.
 *
 * When calculating a compounded deposit, we compare the current scale to the deposit's scale snapshot. If they're equal, the compounded deposit is given by d_t * P/P_t.
 * If it spans one scale change, it is given by d_t * P/(P_t * 1e9).
 *
 *  --- TRACKING DEPOSITOR'S COLL GAIN OVER SCALE CHANGES  ---
 *
 * We calculate the depositor's accumulated Coll gain for the scale at which they made the deposit, using the Coll gain formula:
 * e_1 = d_t * (S - S_t) / P_t
 *
 * and also for the scale after, taking care to divide the latter by a factor of 1e9:
 * e_2 = d_t * S / (P_t * 1e9)
 *
 * The gain in the second scale will be full, as the starting point was in the previous scale, thus no need to subtract anything.
 * The deposit therefore was present for reward events from the beginning of that second scale.
 *
 *        S_i-S_t + S_{i+1}
 *      .<--------.------------>
 *      .         .
 *      . S_i     .   S_{i+1}
 *   <--.-------->.<----------->
 *   S_t.         .
 *   <->.         .
 *      t         .
 *  |---+---------|-------------|-----...
 *         i            i+1
 *
 * The sum of (e_1 + e_2) captures the depositor's total accumulated Coll gain, handling the case where their
 * deposit spanned one scale change.
 *
 * --- UPDATING P WHEN A LIQUIDATION OCCURS ---
 *
 * Please see the implementation spec in the proof document, which closely follows on from the compounded deposit / Coll gain derivations:
 * https://github.com/liquity/liquity/blob/master/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf
